A home made receiver to replace a broken one

![Board](garage_receiver.png)

## How it works

This board works with 24V AC power supply and reponds to an RF signal which makes the input C1 and C2 connect to each other and that makes the door open or close. The RF receiver is not included since they are readily
You can use your existing remote by configuring the code with the switches.

## New features

In case you need more features feel free to ask for additions to the board! (Or make a pull request)
